## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Use Railway** - it's the easiest:

- ✅ Connects to GitHub (just click)
- ✅ Auto-deploys when you update code
- ✅ Free trial to test
- ✅ Perfect for beginners

**Alternative:** Render (has free tier, but spins down after 15min)

**Your choice:** Elestio (also good, but Railway is easier)

## 📋 What You Need Before Starting

## 🔐 Important: Password Security

Before deploying, you'll need to set a password for the admin panel.

**DO NOT use:** `signature2025` (that's just for testing)

**DO use:** A strong password like:
- `MySecure2025!Cleans`
- Or use a password manager (1Password, LastPass, etc.)

You'll set this in Railway as an "environment variable" called `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
