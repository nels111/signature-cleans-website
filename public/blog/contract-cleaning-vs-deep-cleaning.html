            <div class="post-content">
                <p class="post-intro">We regularly speak to facilities managers and business owners who aren't sure whether they need a contract cleaning service, a one-off deep clean, or both. The two services solve different problems, and understanding the distinction will help you make the right decision for your premises&mdash;and your budget.</p>

                <h2>What is Contract Cleaning?</h2>
                <p>Contract cleaning is an ongoing, scheduled cleaning service delivered to an agreed specification. It's the routine maintenance that keeps your premises presentable and hygienic on a daily or weekly basis. A typical contract cleaning specification includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Daily tasks</strong> &ndash; Emptying bins, vacuuming high-traffic areas, cleaning washrooms, wiping kitchen surfaces, mopping hard floors, and spot-cleaning as needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weekly tasks</strong> &ndash; Dusting surfaces, cleaning glass partitions, vacuuming all carpeted areas, mopping all hard floors, and restocking consumables.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monthly tasks</strong> &ndash; Detailed dusting of high-level surfaces, cleaning light fittings, wiping skirting boards, and deeper attention to less visible areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quarterly tasks</strong> &ndash; Window cleaning (internal), carpet spot treatment, and furniture upholstery cleaning.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Contract cleaning is typically delivered during set hours&mdash;either before the working day, in the evening, or during office hours depending on the client's preference. The same cleaning team works your site regularly, which means they know the building, understand your expectations, and can maintain a consistent standard.</p>

                <h2>What is Deep Cleaning?</h2>
                <p>Deep cleaning is a more intensive, one-off service that goes beyond the scope of routine maintenance. It targets the areas and surfaces that daily cleaning doesn't reach&mdash;or the accumulated grime that builds up over time despite regular cleaning.</p>
                <p>A deep clean typically covers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hard floor stripping and resealing</strong> &ndash; Removing old polish and wax layers, cleaning the bare floor, and applying fresh sealant and polish to restore the finish.</li>
                    <li><strong>Carpet deep extraction</strong> &ndash; Hot water extraction (steam cleaning) to remove deep-set dirt, stains, and allergens that vacuuming alone can't address.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kitchen deep clean</strong> &ndash; Degreasing extraction hoods, cleaning behind and underneath appliances, descaling taps and fixtures, deep-cleaning ovens and microwaves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Washroom deep clean</strong> &ndash; Descaling tiles and grout, deep-cleaning sanitaryware, treating mould and mildew, replacing worn sealant.</li>
                    <li><strong>High-level cleaning</strong> &ndash; Dusting and cleaning ceiling tiles, air vents, light fittings, and tops of partition walls.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Deep cleaning requires different equipment, stronger cleaning agents, and more time than routine cleaning. It's project-based work with a defined scope and completion date.</p>

                <h2>When Do You Need Each Service?</h2>
                <h3>Contract Cleaning is Right When:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your premises are occupied daily and need regular upkeep</li>
                    <li>You want consistent standards maintained without having to manage cleaning staff in-house</li>
                    <li>You need a reliable, predictable cost for cleaning each month</li>
                    <li>Your building has washrooms, kitchens, or communal areas that require daily attention</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Deep Cleaning is Right When:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You're moving into a new premises and need it brought up to standard before occupation</li>
                    <li>Your building hasn't been thoroughly cleaned in a long time and needs a reset</li>
                    <li>You're preparing for an inspection, audit, or important event</li>
                    <li>Specific areas have built up grime that routine cleaning can't shift (e.g., kitchen extraction systems, stained carpets, discoloured floor finishes)</li>
                    <li>You're at the end of a tenancy and need to return premises in good condition</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How They Work Together</h2>
                <p>The reality is that most well-maintained commercial premises need both services. Contract cleaning handles the day-to-day, but even the best routine cleaning programme can't prevent gradual buildup in certain areas. Floors lose their shine. Carpets darken. Kitchen extraction systems accumulate grease.</p>
                <p>The most effective approach is to pair a strong contract cleaning specification with periodic deep cleans scheduled throughout the year. A common arrangement looks like this:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Daily contract cleaning</strong> &ndash; 5 or 7 days per week, maintaining general cleanliness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quarterly deep cleans</strong> &ndash; Targeting washrooms and kitchens for intensive treatment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Six-monthly floor maintenance</strong> &ndash; Machine scrubbing hard floors and deep-cleaning carpets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Annual full deep clean</strong> &ndash; A comprehensive deep clean covering all areas, often scheduled over a holiday period when the building is quieter.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>When both services are provided by the same company, the coordination is much smoother. The contract cleaning team identifies areas that need deeper attention, and the deep cleaning schedule can be adjusted based on real-world observations rather than arbitrary dates.</p>

                <h2>Getting the Balance Right</h2>
                <p>The biggest mistake we see is businesses relying solely on deep cleans instead of investing in regular contract cleaning. A quarterly deep clean cannot compensate for months of neglected daily maintenance. By the time the deep clean team arrives, the accumulated dirt, bacteria, and wear have already done their damage.</p>
                <p>Conversely, a contract cleaning programme without any periodic deep cleaning will eventually show its limitations. Even with diligent daily cleaning, some tasks require specialist equipment and extended time that routine visits simply can't accommodate.</p>
                <p>The right balance depends on your premises, sector, footfall, and budget. A good cleaning company will help you find the combination that keeps your building in excellent condition year-round, without paying for work you don't need.</p>
