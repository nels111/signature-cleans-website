            <div class="post-content">
                <p class="post-intro">Cleaning a dental surgery or medical practice is fundamentally different from cleaning a standard office. The consequences of getting it wrong are not just aesthetic&mdash;they are clinical. Inadequate cleaning in healthcare settings can lead to healthcare-associated infections, CQC compliance failures, and serious risk to patients and staff. For practice managers in Devon and the South West, understanding what proper infection control cleaning involves is essential to protecting your patients, your team, and your registration.</p>

                <h2>CQC Standards and What They Mean for Cleaning</h2>
                <p>The Care Quality Commission inspects against five key questions, and cleanliness falls primarily under the "Safe" domain. CQC inspectors expect to see documented evidence that your premises are cleaned to an appropriate standard, with clear protocols for infection prevention and control (IPC).</p>
                <p>In practical terms, this means your cleaning provider needs to demonstrate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Written cleaning schedules</strong> &ndash; Detailed task lists specifying what is cleaned, how often, and to what standard, covering every room and surface type.</li>
                    <li><strong>Appropriate chemical selection</strong> &ndash; Use of hospital-grade disinfectants that are effective against the pathogens relevant to your clinical environment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Staff training records</strong> &ndash; Evidence that cleaning operatives have received IPC training specific to healthcare environments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Audit trails</strong> &ndash; Regular documented checks showing that cleaning has been completed and standards are being maintained.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A generic cleaning company using off-the-shelf products and untrained staff will not meet these requirements. If your cleaning fails during a CQC inspection, the consequences can range from an action plan to enforcement notices.</p>

                <h2>Clinical vs Non-Clinical Areas</h2>
                <p>One of the most common mistakes in healthcare cleaning is treating the entire premises the same way. Effective infection control cleaning distinguishes clearly between different zones:</p>

                <h3>Clinical Areas (Surgeries, Treatment Rooms)</h3>
                <p>These spaces require the highest level of cleaning. Surfaces must be decontaminated between patients using appropriate disinfectants. Floors should be cleaned with dedicated mops that are not used elsewhere. Clinical waste must be segregated and disposed of according to HTM 07-01 guidelines. Light fittings, air vents, and high-level surfaces need regular scheduled attention because airborne contaminants settle on them over time.</p>

                <h3>Semi-Clinical Areas (Decontamination Rooms, Labs)</h3>
                <p>These areas handle contaminated instruments and materials. Cleaning must account for potential exposure to blood-borne pathogens. Surfaces should be non-porous and easy to decontaminate, and your cleaner needs to understand the workflow in these rooms to avoid interfering with instrument processing.</p>

                <h3>Non-Clinical Areas (Reception, Waiting Rooms, Offices)</h3>
                <p>While the cleaning standard here is closer to a commercial environment, there are still healthcare-specific considerations. Waiting room chairs need regular sanitisation. Reception desks&mdash;where patients sign in, hand over documents, and make payments&mdash;are high-touch surfaces. Washrooms in clinical environments must meet a higher hygiene standard than a typical office.</p>

                <h2>Colour-Coded Cleaning Systems</h2>
                <p>Cross-contamination is the single biggest risk in healthcare cleaning. The industry-standard solution is a colour-coded system for cloths, mops, and buckets:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Red</strong> &ndash; Washrooms and sanitary areas</li>
                    <li><strong>Blue</strong> &ndash; General low-risk areas (offices, corridors)</li>
                    <li><strong>Green</strong> &ndash; Kitchen and food preparation areas</li>
                    <li><strong>Yellow</strong> &ndash; Clinical areas and isolation rooms</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This system ensures that a cloth used to clean a toilet never ends up wiping down a treatment chair. It sounds obvious, but without a rigorous colour-coded system and trained staff who follow it, cross-contamination happens more easily than you would think. Your cleaning provider should be able to explain their colour-coding protocol and demonstrate that their teams follow it consistently.</p>

                <h2>Training and Competency Requirements</h2>
                <p>Cleaning operatives working in dental and medical environments need training beyond standard commercial cleaning. At a minimum, this should cover:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Infection prevention and control principles</strong> &ndash; Understanding how infections spread and the role cleaning plays in breaking the chain of transmission.</li>
                    <li><strong>COSHH awareness</strong> &ndash; Healthcare cleaning chemicals are more potent than standard products. Staff need to understand safe handling, dilution rates, and contact times.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clinical waste recognition</strong> &ndash; Knowing the difference between clinical and domestic waste, and understanding the correct disposal routes for each.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blood and bodily fluid spillage procedures</strong> &ndash; A documented protocol for dealing with spills safely, including the use of spill kits and personal protective equipment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hand hygiene</strong> &ndash; Cleaners in clinical environments must follow the same hand hygiene protocols as clinical staff.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Documentation That Protects You</h2>
                <p>In a regulated environment, what you can prove matters as much as what you do. Your cleaning provider should supply:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Signed cleaning schedules</strong> &ndash; Completed and signed after every visit, confirming all specified tasks were carried out.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemical data sheets</strong> &ndash; COSHH assessments for every product used on your premises.</li>
                    <li><strong>Training certificates</strong> &ndash; Evidence of IPC training for every operative who works in your practice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Audit reports</strong> &ndash; Regular quality audits with scored assessments and photographic evidence.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When CQC inspectors arrive, having this documentation readily available demonstrates that you take infection control seriously. It also protects you in the event of a complaint or incident&mdash;you can show exactly what was done, when, and by whom.</p>
