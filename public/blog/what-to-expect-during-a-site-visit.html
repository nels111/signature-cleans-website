            <div class="post-content">
                <p class="post-intro">If you have enquired about commercial cleaning, you have probably been told that a site visit is the next step. For many business owners and facilities managers, this raises questions. How long will it take? What will be assessed? Will there be pressure to sign up? At Signature Cleans, we believe in transparency, so here is a straightforward walkthrough of what actually happens when we visit your premises.</p>

                <h2>The Initial Walkthrough</h2>
                <p>Every site visit starts the same way: we walk through your entire premises with you. This is not a quick glance from the doorway. We need to see every room, corridor, stairwell, kitchen, washroom, and storage area to understand the full scope of work.</p>
                <p>During the walkthrough, we are assessing several things:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Floor types and condition</strong> &ndash; Carpet, vinyl, tile, concrete, and hardwood all require different cleaning methods and frequencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Surface materials</strong> &ndash; Worktops, desks, partition types, and wall finishes affect which products and techniques we recommend.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traffic patterns</strong> &ndash; High-footfall areas need more frequent attention. We note entrance points, main corridors, and communal spaces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Current condition</strong> &ndash; If there is a backlog of maintenance (stained carpets, built-up grime on hard floors), we will flag what needs a one-off deep clean versus what can be maintained through regular service.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This walkthrough typically takes between 20 and 45 minutes, depending on the size of your premises. For larger sites with multiple floors or buildings, we may need a little longer.</p>

                <h2>The Specification Discussion</h2>
                <p>After the walkthrough, we sit down with you to discuss what you actually need. This is the most important part of the visit, because every business is different.</p>
                <p>We will ask questions like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are your main concerns with the current cleaning (if you have a provider)?</li>
                    <li>Are there any areas that need special attention or higher standards?</li>
                    <li>Do you have specific requirements around chemicals, sustainability, or fragrance?</li>
                    <li>Are there restricted areas or sensitive equipment we need to be aware of?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We will also share our professional recommendations. If we think certain areas need more frequent cleaning than you have budgeted for, we will say so. If something can be done less often without affecting standards, we will tell you that too. Our aim is a specification that actually works for your environment&mdash;not one that looks good on paper but fails in practice.</p>

                <h2>Access and Logistics</h2>
                <p>A good portion of the visit covers practical matters that many cleaning companies overlook. We discuss:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Access arrangements</strong> &ndash; Key holding, alarm codes, security protocols, and sign-in procedures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preferred cleaning times</strong> &ndash; Early morning, evening, or daytime cleaning each have trade-offs. We help you decide what works best for your operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage</strong> &ndash; Where we can store equipment and supplies on-site.</li>
                    <li><strong>Health and safety</strong> &ndash; Any specific hazards, COSHH requirements, or site rules our team needs to know about.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Frequency Recommendations</h2>
                <p>Based on what we have seen, we will recommend a cleaning frequency tailored to your space. This is not a one-size-fits-all formula. A busy medical practice with 50 patients a day needs a very different schedule from a quiet professional services office with 10 staff.</p>
                <p>We consider occupancy levels, the nature of your business, visitor frequency, and your budget to arrive at a realistic recommendation. If a five-day-a-week service is not within budget, we can often design a three-day specification that prioritises the areas that matter most.</p>

                <h2>From Visit to Quote</h2>
                <p>After the site visit, we go away and build your specification and quote. This typically takes two to three working days. The quote you receive will include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>A detailed cleaning specification</strong> &ndash; Room by room, task by task, with clear frequencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparent pricing</strong> &ndash; A fixed monthly cost with no hidden extras.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recommended start process</strong> &ndash; Including any initial deep clean needed before regular service begins.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>There is no obligation and no follow-up pressure. We send you the quote, you review it in your own time, and we are available to answer any questions. If you would like to adjust the specification&mdash;adding or removing tasks, changing frequencies&mdash;we are happy to revise.</p>

                <p>The site visit is free, takes under an hour, and gives you everything you need to make an informed decision. No commitment, no hard sell&mdash;just a clear picture of what proper cleaning looks like for your premises.</p>
