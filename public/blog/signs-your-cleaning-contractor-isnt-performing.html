            <div class="post-content">
                <p class="post-intro">Most facilities managers don't have time to monitor cleaning closely. You award the contract, agree the specification, and expect it to be delivered. But over time, standards can slip&mdash;and the signs aren't always obvious until the problem is well established. Here are five red flags that suggest your current cleaning contractor isn't performing, and what you can do about each one.</p>

                <h2>1. Inconsistent Standards Across the Building</h2>
                <p>You might notice that the reception area always looks fine, but the back offices, stairwells, or washrooms on upper floors are consistently neglected. This is a classic sign that cleaning staff are prioritising visible areas and cutting corners elsewhere.</p>
                <p>In a well-managed contract, every area receives the attention specified in the cleaning schedule&mdash;not just the spaces visitors see. If standards vary wildly from one part of the building to another, the cleaning specification is either unclear or it's not being followed.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Request a copy of the current cleaning schedule and walk the site against it. Check areas that don't get daily footfall: window sills, skirting boards, behind furniture, and high-level surfaces.</p>

                <h2>2. High Staff Turnover on Your Site</h2>
                <p>If you seem to see a different cleaner every few weeks, that's a problem. High turnover means cleaners don't learn the specifics of your site&mdash;where the problem areas are, how your building works, what your team expects. Every new face means another period of below-par service while they get up to speed.</p>
                <p>Frequent staff changes are usually a symptom of deeper issues within the cleaning company: poor wages, lack of support, or a culture that doesn't value its operatives. The cost of that churn is passed directly to you through inconsistent service.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Ask your contractor directly about staff retention rates. A good company will be able to tell you how long their average cleaner stays with them. If they can't answer or the figure is less than a year, that tells you something important.</p>

                <h2>3. You Can't Get Hold of Anyone</h2>
                <p>When you need to report an issue or request a change, how easy is it to reach your contractor? If emails go unanswered for days, if there's no named account manager, or if the only person you can contact is the owner who's also managing 40 other sites, you have a communication problem.</p>
                <p>Good cleaning companies build communication into their service model. You should have a named point of contact who responds promptly and visits your site regularly&mdash;not just when there's a complaint.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Review your contract for agreed communication standards. If none exist, that's part of the problem. Ask for a regular review meeting (monthly is typical) and a named contact with a direct phone number.</p>

                <h2>4. No Audit or Inspection Process</h2>
                <p>If your cleaning contractor has never shared an audit report, quality score, or inspection summary with you, the chances are they don't conduct them. Without a systematic quality process, there's no way to measure performance objectively, spot trends, or catch problems early.</p>
                <p>Audits aren't just about catching mistakes&mdash;they're about continuous improvement. They demonstrate that a contractor is actively managing your contract rather than just showing up and hoping for the best.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Ask your contractor what quality management processes they have in place. Request copies of any audit or inspection records for your site. If they don't exist, ask them to implement a regular audit schedule. If they can't or won't, it's time to consider alternatives.</p>

                <h2>5. Everything is Reactive, Nothing is Proactive</h2>
                <p>Do you always have to be the one to raise issues? A contractor who only responds to complaints&mdash;rather than identifying and resolving problems before you notice them&mdash;is operating reactively. This approach means problems are always discovered by you or your staff, creating frustration and eroding trust.</p>
                <p>A proactive cleaning contractor anticipates issues. They notice when a washroom dispenser is running low before it runs out. They flag when a floor needs a deep clean before it starts looking shabby. They bring solutions, not excuses.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Track how issues are identified over a month. If every single problem is reported by you or your team, and none are flagged by the contractor, the management of your contract is not working.</p>

                <h2>What Comes Next</h2>
                <p>Identifying these signs doesn't necessarily mean you need to change contractor immediately. Start by raising your concerns formally and giving your current provider a clear opportunity to improve, with specific expectations and a reasonable timeframe. Document everything.</p>
                <p>However, if the problems persist after you've given clear feedback, it's worth going to market. A well-managed cleaning contract should give you confidence, not headaches. You shouldn't have to manage your cleaning company&mdash;they should be managing the service for you.</p>
