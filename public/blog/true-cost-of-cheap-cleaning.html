            <div class="post-content">
                <p class="post-intro">When you're reviewing cleaning quotes, it's tempting to go with the lowest number. Budgets are tight, and cleaning can feel like a commodity&mdash;surely one company mopping a floor is much the same as another? In reality, the cheapest cleaning quote almost always ends up costing you more. Not on the invoice, but in the time, frustration, and hidden expenses that follow.</p>

                <h2>How Low Prices Are Achieved</h2>
                <p>If one quote comes in significantly below the others, it's worth asking how. Cleaning is a labour-intensive industry. The materials and equipment are a relatively small part of the cost&mdash;the majority goes on wages, management, and overheads. When a company undercuts the market, the savings have to come from somewhere:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Paying staff less</strong> &ndash; Below-market wages attract fewer applicants and higher turnover. You end up with a revolving door of cleaners who don't know your site and aren't invested in the work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cutting hours</strong> &ndash; A quote might look cheaper because they've allocated fewer hours than the job actually requires. The result is rushed cleaning, missed tasks, and declining standards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reducing supervision</strong> &ndash; Proper account management costs money. Cheap providers often have one person overseeing dozens of sites, which means your building rarely gets a management visit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Using cheaper products</strong> &ndash; Lower-quality cleaning chemicals and equipment can leave surfaces looking dull, cause damage over time, or simply not clean effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skipping accreditations</strong> &ndash; Maintaining standards like SSIP and CQMS costs money. Companies that don't invest in compliance can quote lower, but they're also less likely to manage risk properly.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Hidden Costs You Don't See on the Invoice</h2>
                <p>The real expense of a cheap cleaning contract doesn't appear on any bill. It shows up in other ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Your time</strong> &ndash; Every complaint you have to raise, every follow-up email you send, every meeting to discuss standards that aren't being met&mdash;that's your time being consumed by a problem that shouldn't exist.</li>
                    <li><strong>Staff complaints</strong> &ndash; Dirty washrooms, overflowing bins, and grimy kitchens affect employee morale. Your team notices, and they'll tell you about it. Repeatedly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Damage and wear</strong> &ndash; Floors that aren't properly maintained deteriorate faster. Carpets that are rarely deep-cleaned need replacing sooner. These are capital costs that dwarf any monthly cleaning saving.</li>
                    <li><strong>Switching costs</strong> &ndash; When the cheap contract inevitably fails, you'll spend time and money going back to market, running another procurement, and mobilising a new provider. Most cleaning contract changes take 4&ndash;8 weeks to fully bed in.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reputation risk</strong> &ndash; If clients, visitors, or customers see a poorly maintained facility, the impression sticks. You can't put a price on that, but the impact is real.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What Fair Pricing Actually Looks Like</h2>
                <p>Fair pricing in commercial cleaning reflects a realistic allocation of hours, paid at a fair wage, with proper management and overheads built in. As a rough guide, the cost should account for:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Wages</strong> &ndash; Cleaning staff paid at or above the Real Living Wage, with holiday pay, pension, and sick pay.</li>
                    <li><strong>Materials and equipment</strong> &ndash; Quality cleaning chemicals, colour-coded microfibre systems, and well-maintained machinery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Management time</strong> &ndash; Regular site visits, quality audits, staff supervision, and client communication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Overheads</strong> &ndash; Insurance, accreditations, training, uniforms, HR, and administration.</li>
                    <li><strong>A reasonable margin</strong> &ndash; A contractor that operates at razor-thin margins won't invest in their service. A fair margin ensures they can deliver consistently.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If a quote strips out any of these elements, the saving will come at your expense, not theirs.</p>

                <h2>How to Evaluate Value, Not Just Cost</h2>
                <p>When comparing cleaning quotes, look beyond the bottom line. Consider these questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have they visited your site and assessed the scope properly?</li>
                    <li>Does the quote include a detailed specification with task frequencies?</li>
                    <li>What management structure is included? How often will they visit?</li>
                    <li>What accreditations do they hold?</li>
                    <li>Can they provide references from similar sites?</li>
                    <li>How do they handle complaints and quality issues?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A slightly higher monthly cost that delivers consistent quality, responsive management, and peace of mind is vastly better value than a low price that creates ongoing problems. The best cleaning contract is the one you don't have to think about because it just works.</p>
