            <div class="post-content">
                <p class="post-intro">Choosing a commercial cleaning contractor is one of those decisions that seems straightforward until you start comparing quotes. Prices vary wildly, everyone claims to offer "the highest standards," and it can be genuinely difficult to tell who will actually deliver. If you're a facilities manager or business owner responsible for this decision, here's a practical framework for cutting through the noise and finding a contractor you can rely on.</p>

                <h2>Start with Accreditations and Compliance</h2>
                <p>Accreditations are the quickest way to separate serious operators from those who are winging it. Two in particular matter for commercial cleaning in the UK:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SSIP (Safety Schemes in Procurement)</strong> &ndash; This demonstrates that a contractor has been independently assessed against core health and safety standards. If you're procuring cleaning for any environment where H&S is taken seriously&mdash;and it should be everywhere&mdash;SSIP membership is a baseline requirement. It's also mandatory for accessing most construction sites and many public sector contracts.</li>
                    <li><strong>CQMS (Contractors Quality Management Standard)</strong> &ndash; This goes beyond health and safety to verify that a company has robust quality management systems in place. It tells you they have documented processes, not just good intentions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ask to see certificates. Check they're current. A company that has invested in accreditation has demonstrated a commitment to operating professionally.</p>

                <h2>Verify Insurance and Employment Practices</h2>
                <p>This is where many procurement processes fall short. Always request:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Public liability insurance</strong> &ndash; A minimum of &pound;5 million is standard for commercial contracts. Some sectors require &pound;10 million.</li>
                    <li><strong>Employer's liability insurance</strong> &ndash; This is a legal requirement for any company with employees. If they can't produce it, walk away.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proof of PAYE employment</strong> &ndash; Some cleaning companies use self-employed operatives to reduce their costs. This creates risk for you as the client. If HMRC determines that those workers should be employed, you could face liability. Ask directly: are your cleaning staff employed by you, on your payroll, with holiday pay and pension contributions?</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Ask for References and Visit Their Sites</h2>
                <p>Any reputable cleaning company should be able to provide references from current clients in similar sectors. But don't just ask for names&mdash;actually call them. Ask specific questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How long have they been your cleaning contractor?</li>
                    <li>How do they handle problems when they arise?</li>
                    <li>Have you ever had to escalate an issue, and how was it resolved?</li>
                    <li>Would you recommend them to a colleague?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Better still, ask if you can visit one of their current sites. You'll learn more in a 15-minute walkthrough than you will from any tender document. Look at the details: skirting boards, bin areas, washrooms. That's where standards show.</p>

                <h2>Understand Their Management Structure</h2>
                <p>One of the biggest differences between a good cleaning company and an unreliable one is what happens between winning the contract and the cleaning staff arriving on site. Ask about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Account management</strong> &ndash; Who is your day-to-day contact? How often will they visit your site?</li>
                    <li><strong>Supervision</strong> &ndash; How are cleaning teams supervised, especially on evening or weekend shifts?</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality audits</strong> &ndash; Do they conduct regular inspections? How are results shared with you?</li>
                    <li><strong>Staff training</strong> &ndash; How are new cleaners inducted on your site? What ongoing training is provided?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A company that relies on a single person to manage everything&mdash;sales, operations, HR, and quality&mdash;will inevitably let things slip. Look for a clear structure with defined roles.</p>

                <h2>Evaluate Communication Before You Sign</h2>
                <p>Pay attention to how a potential contractor communicates during the tender process. It's a reliable indicator of how they'll communicate once they have your business. Are they responsive to emails? Do they turn up on time for site visits? Do they ask intelligent questions about your requirements, or just quote a number?</p>
                <p>The best cleaning contractors treat the procurement process as a collaboration. They want to understand your site, your priorities, and your pain points before they put a price on paper. If a company quotes without visiting your premises, that's a significant red flag.</p>

                <h3>A Quick Checklist</h3>
                <p>Before making your final decision, confirm:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Current SSIP and/or CQMS accreditation</li>
                    <li>Adequate insurance (public liability and employer's liability)</li>
                    <li>Staff employed on PAYE with proper contracts</li>
                    <li>At least two contactable client references</li>
                    <li>A named account manager for your site</li>
                    <li>A documented quality audit process</li>
                    <li>A site visit completed before quoting</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Taking the time to evaluate these factors properly will save you significant hassle down the line. A cleaning contract that works well is one you barely have to think about. A bad one will consume your time with complaints, follow-ups, and the eventual cost of switching providers.</p>
